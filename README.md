# RemoteControlledDogFoodDispenser
A short code for a simple dog food dispensing mechanism

This was created for a project intended to use a circular disk inside of a mason jar to dispense dog food similar to the way gumball machines work.
A simple microservo was connected to the center of the dispensing disk and an Ir receiver attached to the arduino.
The code was modified to fit my specific IR remote and will need to be modified to fit other ones.
